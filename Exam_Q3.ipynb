Players receive feedback on whether their guess is greater than or less than the mystery number. If the player cannot guess the secret number within ten tries, print out a message that they are out of guesses and display the number. The notebook is not working. It contains errors and does not follow industry best practices. Look at the output cell for an example of the correct output for a player winning the game.\n",
